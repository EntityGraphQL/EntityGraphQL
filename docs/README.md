# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Run `sh publish.sh <version>` to publish docs. (requires write access to git@github.com:entitygraphql/entitygraphql.github.io.git)
